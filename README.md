# Odd Adventure Among Bizarre Objects
Augmented reality (AR) is changing the way we create and interact with artistic creations. The aim of this project is to redesign the usual objects with lines and simple shapes, change their characteristics, and provide the opportunity to explore these objects in a way that is not possible in the real world. The result of this project will be an application which tries to provide a pleasant exploration among imaginitive stars.
